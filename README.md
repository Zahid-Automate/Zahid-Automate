### Hi there I am Mohammed A Zahid ðŸ‘‹

I'm an enthusiastic QA, working on Automation is my priority. I'm passionate about coding to make people's daily life more easier.
I love to learning new things since I got acquainted with programming.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Automation of Rest API's using RestAssured and UI automation using Selenium Java
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning - How to improvise my coding skills everyday, as I believe everyday is a new learning curve
- ðŸ’» Along with finding bugs - Writing Readable & Reusable code are my first priorities.
